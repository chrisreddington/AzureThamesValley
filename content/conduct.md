Azure Thames Valley is an open and inclusive environment for all to come together. We expect everyone in our community, whether attending events (physically or virtually) or representing our community to treat each other respectfully. 

The organizers of Azure Thames Valley, its attendees, speakers, and sponsors are required to agree with the following code of conduct.   

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free community experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.  

We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment in any form whatsoever. This applies to verbal or written forms and includes images, videos, GIFs, sounds or any other form of communication. 

Our aim is to foster a community that is open to all and strives to: 

* Be friendly and patient. 
* Be welcoming: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. 
* Be considerate. 
* Be respectful: You may not agree with each other all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners.

We are committed to providing a welcoming community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honoured. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community. 

## Reporting Process

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour—or have any other concerns—please report it by contacting us via one of these methods: 

Contact the Organizers through the meetup.com website.

In person while at an event - please ask to speak to a committee member. 

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour

Unacceptable behaviour from any community member will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately. 

If a community member engages in unacceptable behaviour, the community organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning. 

We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. 

Attendees or speakers violating these rules will be asked to leave the meeting, and will be refused entrance to future meetings.
