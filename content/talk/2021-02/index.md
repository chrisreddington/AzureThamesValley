title: Storage in Azure
event: Feb 2021 Meetup
event_url: https://www.meetup.com/Azure-Thames-Valley/
location: Reading, United Kingdom
summary: Storage in Azure is a minefield. There’s queues, files, blobs, tables. Then there is hot, cold, archive, standard, premium, ultra. Storage can be version 1 or version 2 and a ‘blob’ storage account doesn’t even allow you to store all types of blob! The different options have different prices, performance, and availability. So having knowledge of how all of these storage options work, along with their limitations, will ensure that you choose the right platform, for the right data.
