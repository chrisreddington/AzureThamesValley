title: Automating Infrastructure as code best practices with ARM and Checkov
event: June 2021 Meetup
event_url: https://www.meetup.com/Azure-Thames-Valley/events/277008295/
location: Virtual
summary: "The security function in most development environments is broken. With engineers focused on features and devops allowing them to move rapidly and self-provision around their own hurdles, it’s impossible for reactive, traditional security tools to keep up with an ever changing production environment. Even with a security engineer within the team, the chance of catching every bad-default in Terraform, an accidental 'False' that needed to be true in ARM, or hidden * in a wide-open access policy is next to impossible with the ever growing suite of cloud services.

In this talk, we’ll show how, (with very little effort) to shift security left into code, enabling automated scanning and highlighting of security risks at build time, with helpful remediation advice for all. Knowing is the first step to improving, and automation makes knowing easy. You bring your CI pipeline, we’ll show you how."
